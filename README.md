# bash.js
A (Lame) JavaScript Bash Emulator
## Overview
This is supposed to be a second attempt to create a JavaScript emulator of bash - the linux command line.
My first attempt was [JSAUCE](https://github.com/Greenscreener/.jsauce), which I discontinued because of the ugliness of the code. This may happen to this repo too, who knows.
This was attempted before, maybe even multiple times, mostly better.
I wanted to do it as a challange, to learn, so be tolerant.
Enjoy.
## Installation (not really)
Just open [http://bashjs.greenscreener.tk](http://bashjs.greenscreener.tk) in your favorite browser (preferably Chrome).

Login with root root.
## What to do
`helloworld` - prints out `Hello World!`

`echo`

`exit` - loggs you out

`clear` - clears the output

`pwd` - prints out path of current working directory

`ls` - prints contents of a directory

`cd` - changes working directory

`mkdir` - makes a new directory

`touch` - makes a new file

`cat` - reads contents of a file

`nyancat` - NYANYANYANYANYANYNYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYN!
