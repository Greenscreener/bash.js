# bash.js
A (Lame) JavaScript Bash Emulator
## Overview
This is supposed to be a second attempt to create a JavaScript emulator of bash - the linux command line.
My first attempt was [JSAUCE](https://github.com/Greenscreener/.jsauce), which I discontinued because of the ugliness of the code. This may happen to this repo too, who knows.
This was attempted before, maybe even multiple times, mostly better.
I wanted to do it as a challange, to learn, so be tolerant.
Enjoy.
## Installation (not really)
Just open [http://bashjs.greenscreener.tk](http://bashjs.greenscreener.tk) in your favorite browser (preferably Chrome).

Login with user: `root`, password: `root`. (I recommend changing your password.)
## What to do
- `helloworld` - prints out `Hello World!`
- `echo`
- `exit` - loggs you out
- `clear` - clears the output
- `pwd` - prints out path of current working directory
- `ls` - prints contents of a directory
- `cd` - changes working directory
- `mkdir` - makes a new directory
- `touch` - makes a new file
- `cat` - reads contents of a file
- `nyancat` - NYANYANYANYANYANYNYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYN!
- `passwd` - changes the password of the current user
- `adduser` - Creates a new user
