# bash.js
A (Lame) JavaScript Bash Emulator
## Overview
This is supposed to be a second attempt to create a JavaScript emulator of bash - the linux command line.
My first attempt was [JSAUCE](https://github.com/Greenscreener/.jsauce), which I discontinued because of the ugliness of the code. This may happen to this repo too, who knows.
This was attempted before, maybe even multiple times, mostly better.
I wanted to do it as a challange, to learn, so be tolerant.
Enjoy.
## Installation
Just open [http://bashjs.greenscreener.tk](http://bashjs.greenscreener.tk) in your favorite browser (preferably Chrome).
PS: Password to any user is `password`
## What to do
`helloworld` - prints out `Hello World!`
`echo`
`exit` - loggs you out
`clear` - clears the output
`pwd` - prints out path of current working directory
`ls` - prints contents of a directory
`cd` - changes working directory
`mkdir` - makes a new directory
`touch` - makes a new file
`cat` - reads contents of a file
